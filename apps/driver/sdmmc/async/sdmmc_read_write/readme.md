# SDMMC driver asynchronous - SDMMC Read Write

This example application shows how to use the SDMMC driver in asynchronous mode to perform block operations on the SD Card Media

## Description

- This example uses the SDMMC driver in asynchronous mode in both Bare-Metal and RTOS environment to perform Block Erase/Write/Read operations on SD-Card

- This application writes 60KB (61440 bytes) of data starting at the SD Card memory location 0x2000
- It then reads and verifies the written data

### Setting up [PIC32MZ Embedded Graphics with Stacked DRAM (DA) Starter Kit (Crypto)](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/DM320010-C)

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- Insert MicroSD Card in the MicroSD Card slot (J10) on the development board

## Running the Application

1. Build and program the application using its IDE
2. The LED is turned ON when the read data from the SD Card matches with the written data

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- |
|  [PIC32MZ Embedded Graphics with Stacked DRAM (DA) Starter Kit (Crypto)](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/DM320010-C) | LED1 |
