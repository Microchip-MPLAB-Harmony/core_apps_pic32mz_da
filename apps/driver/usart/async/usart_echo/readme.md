# USART driver asynchronous - USART echo

This example echoes the received characters over the console using the USART driver in asynchronous mode.

## Description

This example uses the USART driver in asynchronous mode in Bare-Metal environment to communicate over the console. It receives and echo's back the characters entered by the user.

### Setting up [PIC32MZ Embedded Graphics with Stacked DRAM (DA) Starter Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/DM320010)    

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- Connect a micro USB cable to the USART-USB port J5

### Setting up [PIC32MZ Embedded Graphics with Stacked DRAM (DA) Starter Kit (Crypto)](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/DM320010-C)

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- Connect a micro USB cable to the USART-USB port J5

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the EDBG Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application using its IDE
4. Type a character and observe the output on the console as shown below:

    ![output_async_usart_echo](images/output_async_usart_echo.png)

5. LED toggles each time the character is echoed

Refer to the following table for LED name:
